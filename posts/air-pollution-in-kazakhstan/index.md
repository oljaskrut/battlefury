The Republic of Kazakhstan holds the 23rd place in the list of most polluted countries in the world. Most of the pollution is caused by the cars and production facilities, which emit a huge amount of the gas, steam and dust into the atmosphere. 

Considering the population in Kazakhstan, which is more than 19 million people, the emission of gases from cars is quite a significant problem for the country. 

There is the list of most air polluted states in Kazakhstan:

In the first place, the state of Talghar, most of the housing in Talghar state uses coal as the heating, therefore the emission is so high.

In second place is Shymkent city, which has the most average number of cars per capita. 

As the government decided to decrease the pollution and reach carbon neutrality by 2060, several laws were adopted. The first and major law is the limitation of import of old cars made before 2007, and the cars have to meet the requirements of EURO 4. Moreover, there is a dynamic development of production of eco energy in the energy sector of Kazakhstan.
