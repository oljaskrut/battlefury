The two countries are working together on green energy initiatives. In 2021, the Kazakhstan Ministry of Energy and the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development signed an agreement to develop renewable energy projects in Kazakhstan, with a focus on solar and wind energy. The UAE has also invested in the construction of a solar power plant in Kazakhstan with a capacity of 100 MW. This year, during the visit of Qasym-Jomart Tokayev to UAE, the heads of the states discussed the future development of the green energy sector. 

In terms of leaders, the President of Kazakhstan is Qasym-Jomart Tokayev and the current President of the UAE is Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. President Tokayev has stated that Kazakhstan's future energy strategy will focus on increasing the use of renewable energy sources, while President Al Nahyan has announced plans to make the UAE a global leader in clean energy by investing in renewable energy projects and research and development in the field. Both countries have similar goals on green energy, UAE plans to reach zero carbon emission by 2050, Kazakhstan plans to reach the same goal by 2060.

Developing green energy and oil, gas production simultaneously is a contradictory but common goal for these countries, as the President of UAE has mentioned, it is the goal that has to be reached for the health of the new generation. 

The visit of Qasym-Jomart Tokayed and warm hospitality of Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan led to the adoption of 9 important agreements between these countries. One of them is the agreement of the future investments to the renewable energy sector of Kazakhstan.  The new project, estimated around $2.5 billion, is about setting up a new substation in the Southern part of Kazakhstan. The new substation is estimated to generate from 500 to 2000 MWt of energy and is going to be able to accumulate the excessive energy. 

For now, those are the whole details of the renewable energy development agreements between these countries. At the end of the visit, the President of Kazakhstan Qasym-Jomart Tokayev invited Mohamedd bin Zayed Al Nahyan to Kazakhstan for further development of relationships.

Overall, Kazakhstan and the UAE are constantly developing strong economic and diplomatic relationships, with the UAE making significant investments in Kazakhstan, particularly in the energy sector, and the two countries working together on green energy initiatives.
