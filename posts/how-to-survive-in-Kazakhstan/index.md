Today, we had an interview with a Polish tourist who has visited Kazakhstan this year. His excitement was immeasurable and he has shared with us some tips for tourists visiting Kazakhstan. 

“First of all, you need a smartphone, cause everything here is related to the internet or online banking, or something like these. When I got there, I bought a SIM card, and connected to the internet, because the taxi prices near the airport were really high, so some locals recommended that I order a Yandex taxi.”

Actually, during the whole interview, our anonymous tourist suggested three apps in total: Yandex Taxi, Kaspi Bank, 2GIS. The first app is for ordering the taxi and food, Kaspi is the most popular online bank in Kazakhstan and 2GIS is pretty precise GPS for Kazakhstan. 

“I was delighted to see such beautiful nature. I have visited some lakes near Almaty, and have been in Shymkent. Unfortunately, I had no time to visit the capital city Astana, and western part of the country. I think this summer, I will make a tour to these places.” 

According to our interviewee, every fifth person speaks English, and some people also understand the Polish language because of its similarity with Russian language. He had some time for clubbing in Almaty, visited the sights of Shymkent and met the nature of South Kazakhstan.
