The United Kingdom is covering up from the deeds of the last and least time served prime minister - Liz Truss. But nowadays, the UK is facing new old problems of shortage of qualified plumbers, construction workers and engineers. 

One of the reasons for this shortage is that many workers from EU countries, who previously filled these roles in the UK, have returned to their home countries due to uncertainty surrounding their rights and status in the UK post-Brexit. This has led to a decrease in the number of workers available to fill these roles.

Additionally, the UK has seen an increase in demand for these professionals due to a number of factors, including a growing population and an increase in construction and infrastructure projects. This has led to a further strain on the already limited pool of qualified workers.

The shortage of skilled workers has led to delays in construction projects, higher costs for employers and homeowners, and difficulty in maintaining and upgrading infrastructure. This issue is also affecting the economy and the UK's competitiveness in the international market.
To address this problem, the UK government has launched several initiatives to attract more workers from outside the EU, such as increasing the number of Tier 2 visas available to skilled workers, and investing in training and apprenticeship programs to increase the number of domestic workers with the necessary skills. However, the impact of these measures is yet to be seen.

The impact of the problem also occurred on prices for such types of works.
