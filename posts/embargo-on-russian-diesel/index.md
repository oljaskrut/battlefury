In December of last year, the European Union imposed an embargo on Russian crude oil supply and gas, however consequences have not affected Europe in any way. But, in the last week, the G7 embargo on Russian oil products came into force, which means that another challenge awaits Europe.

“Europe needs to import three million barrels a day, and it receives a third of this volume from Russia. Where can I get a million barrels of diesel fuel per day? That's where the critical point is. A large deficit is expected” says Chief economist of Argus Energy Group David Fyfe.

Russia accounts for 6.5% of the world's oil refining capacity. Putin can reduce this figure by allowing his oil to flow freely to India, China and Latin America for processing at their factories. Thus, he will cause maximum pain to Europe and will not cause significant harm to friendly and neutral states.
