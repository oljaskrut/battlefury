It has been more than two months since the anti-judicial reform protests in Israel started. Since the beginning of the protest, the number of people protesting against the reforms in the judicial system is rising. 

### How it started

In December, 2022, the right-wing party led by Benjamin Netanyahu won the legislative election, and on 4th January 2023, new Justice Minister - Yariv Levin announced future plans of reforms in the judicial system of Israel. The reform includes the limitation of power of the Supreme Court and governing legal councils. This power would be partly divided among the party which was controversial for most of the people in Israel. After the announcement of reform, the Crime Minister and Standing-Together activist party announced their intention to organize a protest against this reform. 

### Protests in numbers

On 7th January 2023, the first protest appeared in the streets of Tel Aviv, a city in Gush Dan metropolitan in Israel, and around 20,000 attended the first protest against the reform. However, the number of protest attendants rose every week, as the protests were held every Saturday. On 14th January, 80,000 people protested in Tel Aviv, and smaller protests in Haifa and Jerusalem. For now, organizers said that around 500,000 pro-democracy protesters attended the Saturday (11th March) protest, as a result Israeli Haaretz newspaper called it "the largest demonstration in the country's history".
