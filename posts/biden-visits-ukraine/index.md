It is a big surprise visit of Joe Biden to Ukraine. Previously, White House announced that the President of the United States will travel to Poland on February 20 for a two-day visit. The visit to Poland was assumed to be about the US troops presence in its territory, but after 10 hours on train, Biden visited Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. 

	The White House mentions that the visit was planned before and was not announced due to the safety reasons of Western Leader. Joseph Biden, welcome to Kyiv! Your visit is an extremely important sign of support for all Ukrainians, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on social media.

	The White House said, Biden would announce the delivery of military equipment and weapons for Ukraine which are worth $500 million. The assistance also includes tanks, ammunition and anti-armor systems.
