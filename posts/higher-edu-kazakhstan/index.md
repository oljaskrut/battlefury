The higher education in Kazakhstan is quite unique and has lots of differences from other countries in the world. There are more than 130 ethnicities living in Kazakhstan and students get unique experience of various traditions in the world. 

The first and major difference is the scholarships system for resident students in higher education. The students who graduated from the secondary schools pass the Unified National Testing, by the results of testing they are able to get full scholarships in different universities in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the students also are able to receive free education after graduation from colleges (colleges and universities are at different levels in the education system of Kazakhstan). 

The bachelor degree by majors lasts for 4 years, to get the master's degree it takes around 2 years, and for PHD, students have to study at least extra 3 years and have to have work experience. 

Also, most of the universities in Kazakhstan offer scholarships to overseas students. The government also offers various scholarships to encourage international students to study in Kazakhstan.
