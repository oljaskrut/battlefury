Thanks for checking out my blog template. It's based on the blog I built for my own [website](https://mattjennings.io) and I hope this is a good starting point for you to start yours.

Let's go over a few quick things:

- This template was built with `@sveltejs/kit@1.0.0`

- The theme of this blog is heavily borrowed from Tailwind's ["Spotlight" blog template](https://spotlight.tailwindui.com/). This is _not_ a port of that template, but the styling is pretty much the same.

- You should edit the `src/lib/info.js` file to contain your information. This will properly update the parts of the website that display your name, social links, and SEO (meta tags) for your posts.

Now that that's out of the way, let's learn about how to make posts.
