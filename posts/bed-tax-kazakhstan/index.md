A hotel tax or lodging tax is charged in most of the countries, to travelers when they rent accommodations. The amount of charge varies in different countries. For the first time, in 1977 in the UK, the amount of bed taxes were set as a 1% of total cost of the rent, then this amount continuously raised till 2008 when its share reached the 5%. 

The main difference of bed taxes is that the money collected as the taxes does not reach the country government, but only the state government. The taxes collected from tourists were assumed to assist in development of tourism and tourism infrastructure in the state. However, the states are used to spending these taxes in benefit of state purposes, such as salaries of policemen, firefighters, etc.

In Kazakhstan, the adoption of bed taxes (hotel taxes) was taken into discussion in 2018, but its adoption has been planned to begin at the end of 2021. On 1 January 2022, the bed tax was legislated in the controversial amount of 0% until the end of 2022. In the beginning of 2023, the tax rate had sufficient changes in amount reaching the 5% at its maximum point and 1% at minimum point. The bed tax is directly related to the quantity of rented accommodation for tourists. As a result, the topic appeared to be controversial for the KAGIR (Kazakhstan Association of Hotels & Restaurants). 

On the official Facebook page, the association has shared the statement on purpose to revise the bed tax code and define the exact calculation mechanism and type of bills which have to be provided to tourists. According to the KAGIR, the association receives a huge number of questions from entrepreneurs about the bed tax code.

On behalf of the hotels of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kazakhstan Association of Hotels and Restaurants (KAGiR) offers:

1. Apply a zero rate for 2023;

2. To finalize the mechanism for the implementation of the tourist contribution, taking into account the opinion of the market;

3. Replace the interest rate with a fixed one;

4. To launch the introduced rules in pilot mode first in Astana and Almaty from 2024;

5. Finalize the mechanism for implementing the Decree of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated November 5, 2021 No. 787, taking into account the need to provide a clear mechanism for the targeted spending of funds collected from the tourist contribution exclusively for the development of tourism.

For now, the city Shymkent adopted the temporary maratory to pay the bed tax.
