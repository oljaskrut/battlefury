 Current situation in the world forces many countries to raise the interest rate, most of these countries are directly related to Russian exports. 

 Most countries in Europe halt the rise of interest rates in order to keep up the business in the country, such countries are Poland, Czech Republic and Norway. However in other European countries the interest rate was raised from 0.25 to 0.5%. 

 The top country with the lowest interest rate for a moment is Japan, which has a -0.1% interest rate. And Zimbabwe has the highest interest rate in the world, indicating 150% in February of this year. The data was collected from tradingeconomics.com. 

 Such a situation in the world caused the chain ruled consequences, by leading the whole world into hard times. I, as you, am waiting for the end of this catastrophe.
