The Russian-Ukraine War which is lasting more than a year is undoubtedly the worst thing happening in the new world. At the same time, the war is showing us the future of the war industry.

One of the key moments in that war has become the use of unmanned drones not only to spy on the opponent but also to deal the damage to opponent targets. The small handy planes dealing the huge damage to the targets are not the high-tech developments, instead low-tech war machines. 

Most drones have the engine of a scooter and carry lots of explosive substances which make them cheap in production. The cheapest military jets cost at least $25,000,000, preparing the pilot and life of pilot costs much more.  While the kamikaze drones prices start from $20,000 and the price is continuously reducing. Such technology instead of development is recessing technologically, less parts and more explosives.
