Protests in France occur periodically, and various classes of society take to the streets to express their dissatisfaction with the circumstances, wages, working conditions, unemployment and many other reasons. Unfortunately, many problems in France were solved after the protests, and later people got used to protesting in order not only to express dissatisfaction, but also to solve social problems. For the French, protest is more about self-expression, not a chaotic riot.

The last national protest in France took place in 2018 and was called the "Yellow Vest Movement", where the French expressed dissatisfaction with income inequality in France. But now another protest against the controversial reform of the French pension system continues.

The protests began on January 19th, right after the announcement of the reforms in the pension system of France. Demonstrations were directed against President of France, Emanuel Macronâ€™s future plans of reforming of retirement ages. According to the reform,  the retirement age will increase from 62 to 64 years. The announcement caused widespread disruption, garbage piling up in the streets. The students have joined the demonstrations in January by significantly increasing the number of demonstrators. Lately, other social groups have joined the protests and the amount of people protesting exceeded millions. 

The policemen suffered most in the protests, the number of wounded gendarmes outnumbered 150. Because of vandalism and rowdiness, the streets of French cities are unsafe for a moment. 

Massive demonstrations are already giving results in future reforms, the fact is that reform of the pension system is not legalized yet.
