In 2022 and 2023, the supply chain for uranium, a key component in atomic energy, has been impacted by sanctions placed on the Russian Federation. These sanctions have made it difficult for Russia and Rosatom company (company which distributes and produces enriched uranium), a major supplier of uranium, to export the material to other countries. As a result, other countries that are major suppliers of uranium, such as Kazakhstan, have also been affected.

Kazakhstan is particularly important in the atomic energy sector, as it is the world's largest producer of uranium. In 2022, Kazakhstan produced about 40% of the world's uranium, and the country's mines are responsible for supplying many nuclear power plants around the world. However, due to the sanctions on Russia and the resulting disruption in the supply chain, Kazakhstan's uranium exports have been blocked and the world's atomic energy industry is facing a shortage of this key resource.

Due to the fact that Kazakhstan is a landlocked country, the distribution and enrichment of uranium were done through Russia, but now, after the investigation of Rosatom company in financial support of the Russian - Ukraine War, the governments of many countries which use uranium for energy production are thinking about the sanctions directed to Rosatom.

There is an option of rebuilding the supply chain via China, but the Nuclear Intelligence Weekly says that it is quite complicated due to the trade tensions. 

For now, the United States and other European countries are looking for other suppliers of enriched uranium.
