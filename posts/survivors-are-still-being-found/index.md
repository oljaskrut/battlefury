Almost two weeks after the earthquake in Turkey, survivors are still being found. The ruins of the buildings killed around 45 thousand people and more than one million people left homeless.

Rescue teams are still continuing the excavation works of ruins and yesterday by miracle were saved three people including a child. However the areas still lack rescue teams and medical assistants. Some people mention that there is an awful stink due to the dead bodies and ruins of buildings. 

Also in Syria, around 5800 deaths have been reported, the vast majority are from the northwest part of Syria. The World Health Organization says that around 26 million people need humanitarian aid.
