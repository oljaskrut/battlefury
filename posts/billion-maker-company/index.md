Arabian-American Oil Company or simply Aramco announced profit of **$161 billion** for the year of 2022. Aramco is the Saudi Arabian public company which produces and distributes petroleum and natural gas. And in the last year, tough circumstances for other countries became a fortune for oil producer companies in general.

While the competitor companies such as **ExconMobil** and **Shell** profited $55,7 billion and $39,9 billion respectively, Aramco somehow made $161 billion. It represents a **46,5%** rise in profit for the company, after the post-pandemic years, Saudi oil giant announced it as a record profit in their history. 

The main reason for such profit is the **Ukrainian-Russian War** and sanctions on Russian oil. After sanctions on Russian oil were applied, Europe, Asia and North America are trying to refund the import of oil from other suppliers. This caused a rise of oil prices globally exceeding $120 per barrel. Aramco as one of the largest producers of oil and gas increased the production amount and sold more oil with higher prices. 

The main difference between Aramco and other oil producers is that the company is ruled by the Saudi Arabian royal family. Also Aramco spends a lot of money on exploration of new oil and gas reservoirs, by producing more and more oil.
